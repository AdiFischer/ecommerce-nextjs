Guidelines for raising a pull request:
Each pull request should have an appropriate and short title like "Fixed Bug in Experience Page"

In case of multiple commits, please perform a rebase and make a squash commit before giving the pull request.

Pull Requests without a description would often not be reviewed. Make sure you describe your intended changes in the description section of the pull request. (Use bullet points and phrases)

Make sure to refer the respective issue in the respective PR using phrases like Resolves #issue_number or Closes #issue_number. Here's an example to raise a PR:
```
 Fixes #640

# Work Done:

- Fixed Responsiveness bug in the MOOC Section of the Education Page
- Made the Favicon more optimized
- ...
- ...
- ...
```
# Relevant Screenshots/Gifs
Refrain from using phrases like "Hi, I am ..", "Please merge me this PR", "Thank You..", etc. We are only interested in technical parts.

Attach a screenshot/clip of the change(s).

Please be patient enough. The project maintainers/mentors would review it as per their schedule. Please do not start putting comments like "Please check this" etc.

Not every PR would be merged directly. In majority of the scenarios, we would be offering some additional suggestions which are to be incorporated in the same PR with a squash commit.

Look out for possible merge conflicts. Please add comments required, this makes your code readable.

Make sensible variable names. For example, card1 is quite ambiguous but education_card implies what that variable is declared for.

Although we support feedback from everyone in all phases of development, it is highly advised not to put any negative comments in other participant's pull requests.

Always keep a note of the deadline.

9. Voila ‚ùó You have made a PR to the ecommerce-nextjs project üí• . Sit back patiently and relax while the project maintainers review your PR. Please understand at times the time can vary from a few hours to a few days.
